  ## Description  
  Generates a professional readme for your projects!

  ## Installation
  To use the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the repository in your preferred code editor.
From the root folder, run the command 'npm install' in your terminal to install dependencies.
From the root folder, run the command 'node index.js' in your terminal to start the application.
Answer the questions as prompted. To remove a section from the README, delete all contents from the text field. Otherwise, it will create the section in the README with the default message of No information provided.
